Older Google Data (GData) APIs use XML as their underlying format, but most Google APIs have released newer versions of their APIs based on JSON. You should migrate your code to use the new API infrastructure that is based on JSON. Likewise, if you have an existing application that uses the GData Java client library, you need to update your code to use the [Google APIs Client Library for Java](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/), as described on the [migration](https://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/wiki/MigratingToGoogleApiJavaClient) page.

We have stopped actively developing the GData Java client library. For information about the GData status of relevant Google APIs, see the [GData API Directory](https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/directory).
